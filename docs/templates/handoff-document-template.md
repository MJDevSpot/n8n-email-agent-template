## How to Use

### Daily Operation

Your Email Co-Pilot works automatically. When an email arrives:

1. System reads and classifies the email
2. AI drafts an appropriate response
3. Response is sent (or held for review)
4. You receive a Slack notification
5. Record is logged in Airtable

**You don't need to do anything for routine inquiries.**

### Reviewing Activity

**Airtable Dashboard:** [AIRTABLE_LINK]

Here you can:
- See all processed emails
- Review AI drafts and sent responses
- Add notes for your records
- Track classifications and status

**Slack Channel:** [SLACK_CHANNEL]

Receive real-time notifications for:
- New emails processed
- Meetings booked
- Items requiring attention

### When You Need to Act

The AI will flag these for your direct attention:
- [HUMAN_REQUIRED_TOPICS]

You'll see these in Slack with a note that human response is needed.

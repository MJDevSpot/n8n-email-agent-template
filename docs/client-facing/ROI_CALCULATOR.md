```

- Current response time: 14 hours
- Current booking rate: 10%
- New booking rate: 35%
- Close rate: 40%
- Average deal value: $5,000

**Calculation:**

| Metric | Current | With Co-Pilot | Difference |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|

## Response Time Impact

Research shows booking rates correlate directly with response speed:

| Response Time | Relative Booking Rate | Industry Data |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| < 5 minutes | 100% (baseline) | InsideSales.com |
| 30 minutes | 60% | Harvard Business Review |
| 1 hour | 45% | Lead Response Management |
| 4 hours | 25% | MIT Study |
| 12+ hours | 15% | Industry average |

**Implication:** Moving from 12-hour response to 5-minute response can more than double your booking rate.

Current response time (hours):  _____
Current booking rate (%):       _____
Close rate (%):                 _____
Average deal value ($):         _____
```

**Step 2: Current Monthly Performance**

```

**Step 3: Projected Performance (with Co-Pilot)**
```
New booking rate (use 35%):     35%

Meetings booked = Inquiries × 35%
                = _____ × 35% = _____

Customers won = Meetings × Close Rate
              = _____ × _____% = _____

Monthly revenue = Customers × Deal Value

```

**Step 4: Calculate Impact**
```
Additional revenue = Projected - Current
                   = $_____ - $_____ = $_____

Monthly investment =             $497

ROI = Additional Revenue ÷ Investment
    = $_____ ÷ $497 = _____x
